Title: Using Fuzzy Logic and Deep Learning to Improve the Accuracy of Product Star Ratings

Background:

Product star ratings are an important factor that consumers consider when making purchase decisions. However, star ratings can be biased and inaccurate. This is because star ratings are often based on a small number of reviews, and they can be influenced by factors such as the reviewer's mood and the type of product being reviewed.

Objectives:

This project aims to develop a new method for predicting product star ratings using fuzzy logic and deep learning. The proposed method will be able to learn the complex relationships between the words and phrases in reviews and the corresponding star ratings. This will allow the proposed method to generate more accurate and unbiased star ratings than traditional methods.
